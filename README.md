# JSatTrak
Java Satellite Tracker

This is a fork of a great application created and developed by Shawn E. Gano (shawn@gano.name), whose development started in 2008.
The original site can be found at: https://www.gano.name/shawn/JSatTrak/
The main repository can be found at: https://github.com/sgano/JSatTrak

The main difference found in this fork is the usage of Maven and the full source code of WWJ (0.6) and JOGL-UTILS which does 
not exist in Maven repositories for such versions. For that reason, once you clone the repository you will find three projects: 
a) jsattrak-eclipse, b) wwjbackport and c) joglutilsbackport. Other important difference is the use of Eclipse instead of Netbeans.
